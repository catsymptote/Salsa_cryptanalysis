Text files should be stored as:
'random_090000'
or
'counting_130000'
where these two text files should include
the random input-output pairs between
90000 and 99999, and the counting input-output
pairs between 130000 and 139999, respectively.
For 1 million input-output pairs, we get
100 files, each containing 10000 pairs.
Each of the pairs should be separated with a comma and a space:
'hjfskldhfadf, 983rhyioufhsdf'
